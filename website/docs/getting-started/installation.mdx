# Installation

Get Baeta up and running in your project in just a few steps.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 22.20.0 or above (while Bun and Deno are supported, Node is still needed for the CLI)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) version 5.6 or above
- Package manager of your choice (npm, yarn, pnpm or bun)

## Quick Start

Baeta comes with a `create baeta` command to quickly set up a new project:

import { PackageManagerCreate } from "@site/components/package-manager";

<PackageManagerCreate package="baeta" />

If you prefer to set up the project manually, follow the steps below.

## Setup

### 1. Core Package

First, install the core package which provides all essential functionality:

import { PackageManagerAdd } from "@site/components/package-manager";

<PackageManagerAdd package="@baeta/core" />

This is all you need at runtime for a basic Baeta installation.

### 2. Development Tools

The CLI is required for code generation.

<PackageManagerAdd dev={true} package="@baeta/cli" />

## Next Steps

Once installed, proceed to [configuration](./configuration) to set up your project.
