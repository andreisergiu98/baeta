# Baeta

Baeta is a schema-first, modular, and extensible GraphQL framework for Node.js.
It provides a powerful and flexible architecture for building scalable and maintainable GraphQL APIs.

## Features

- **Modular architecture:** Baeta's modular design allows you to organize your GraphQL API into smaller, more manageable modules that can be added or removed as needed. This makes it easier to maintain and scale your API over time.

- **Schema-first approach:** With Baeta, you define your schema first, and then logic and resolvers. This approach ensures a consistent and well-defined API for your clients and reduces boilerplate code.

- **Type safety:** Baeta provides automatic code generation, which ensures type safety and reduces errors. This improves the stability and reliability of your API.

- **Middleware and directives:** Baeta supports middleware and directives, which allow you to add custom behavior to your resolvers and schema validation. This makes it easy to add authentication, logging, or other custom behavior to your API.
