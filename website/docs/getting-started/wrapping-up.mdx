# Wrapping up

Now that we have our modules ready, let's create and run our GraphQL application.

## Create the application

Create an entry point for your application in `src/app.ts`:

```typescript
import { createServer } from "node:http";
import { createApplication } from "@baeta/core";
import { createYoga } from "graphql-yoga";
// Baeta automatically exports all modules
import modules from "./modules/index.ts";

const baeta = createApplication({
  modules,
});

export const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: baeta.schema,
});

const server = createServer(yoga);

server.listen(4000, () => {
  console.log(
    `ðŸš€ Server ready at http://localhost:4000${yoga.graphqlEndpoint}`,
  );
});
```

:::note
We're using GraphQL Yoga for this example due to its simple setup, but Baeta is compatible with all GraphQL servers like Apollo Server, Express GraphQL, and others.
:::

### Start the application

Run your application with:

```bash
yarn start
```

## What's Next?

Now that you have a running GraphQL API, you can:

- [Add authentication](../extensions/authorization)
- [Implement caching](../extensions/caching)
- [Safeguard from malicious operations](../extensions/complexity)
- [Add validation](../plugins/builtin-directives)
- [Add custom directives](../guides/directives)
