# Installation

Get Baeta up and running in your project in just a few steps.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 22 or above
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) version 5.6 or above
- Package manager of your choice (npm, yarn, or pnpm)

## Setup

### 1. Core Package

First, install the core package which provides all essential functionality:

import { PackageManagerAdd } from "@site/components/package-manager";

<PackageManagerAdd package="@baeta/core" />

This is all you need at runtime for a basic Baeta installation.

### 2. Development Tools

For the best development experience, install our CLI and compiler tools:

<PackageManagerAdd dev={true} package="@baeta/cli @baeta/compiler" />

The compiler is optional but recommended as it provides:

- TypeScript configuration support
- Hot reload of the application

## Next Steps

Once installed, proceed to [configuration](./configuration) to set up your project.
