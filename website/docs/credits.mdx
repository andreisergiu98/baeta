# Credits

Baeta stands on the shoulders of giants. We'd like to acknowledge and thank the following people and projects that have inspired and influenced the development of Baeta:

## [Laurentiu Ciobanu](https://github.com/laurci) (@laurci)

- Impact: A key contributor to Baeta's design phase, helping plan the architecture and providing feedback that shaped the project's direction and developer experience.

## [Uri Goldshtein](https://github.com/Urigo) (@Urigo)

- Project: [GraphQL Modules](https://github.com/Urigo/graphql-modules)
- Impact: The modular architecture of Baeta was heavily inspired by GraphQL Modules. The concept of breaking down GraphQL schemas into smaller, manageable modules while maintaining type safety was a fundamental influence on Baeta's design philosophy.

## [Michael Hayes](https://github.com/hayes) (@hayes)

- Projects: 
  - [Pothos GraphQL](https://pothos-graphql.dev)
  - [Pothos Auth Scope](https://github.com/hayes/pothos/tree/main/packages/plugin-scope-auth)
  - [Pothos Complexity](https://github.com/hayes/pothos/tree/main/packages/plugin-complexity)
- Impact: The authorization plugin concept and complexity plugin implementation in Baeta were influenced by Hayes' excellent work on Pothos GraphQL.

## [Marc Duez](https://github.com/marcduez) (@marcduez)

- Project: [graphql-validation-directives](https://github.com/marcduez/graphql-validation-directives)
- Impact: The validation system in Baeta drew inspiration from Marc's work on GraphQL validation directives.

## Community

We are grateful to the entire GraphQL community for creating an ecosystem of tools and ideas that make projects like Baeta possible.
