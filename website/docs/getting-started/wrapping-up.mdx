# Wrapping up

Now that we have our modules ready, let's create and run our GraphQL application.

## Create the application

Create an entry point for your application in `src/app.ts`:

```typescript
import { createApplication } from "@baeta/core";
import { userModule } from "./modules/user";
import { userPhotosModule } from "./modules/user-photos";

import { createYoga } from "graphql-yoga";
import { createServer } from "node:http";

const baeta = createApplication({
  modules: [userModule, userPhotosModule],
});

const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: baeta.schema,
});

const server = createServer(yoga);

server.listen(4000, () => {
  console.log("ðŸš€ Server ready at http://localhost:4000/graphql");
});
```

:::note
We're using GraphQL Yoga for this example due to its simple setup, but Baeta is compatible with all GraphQL servers like Apollo Server, Express GraphQL, and others.
:::

### Start the application

Run your application with:

```bash
yarn start
```

Or with the full command:

```bash
yarn baeta build --watch --generate --onSuccess='node --enable-source-maps dist/app.js'
```

## What's Next?

Now that you have a running GraphQL API, you can:
- [Add authentication](../intro)
- [Implement caching](../intro)
- [Add custom directives](../intro)
- [Explore best practices](../intro)
