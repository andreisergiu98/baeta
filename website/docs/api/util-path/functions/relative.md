# Function: relative()

> **relative**(`from`, `to`): `string`

Solve the relative path from {from} to {to}.
At times we have two absolute paths, and we need to derive the relative path from one to the other. This is actually the reverse transform of path.resolve.

## Parameters

• **from**: `string`

• **to**: `string`

## Returns

`string`
